```{r}

is_leap_year <- function(year){
  
  if (year %% 100 == 0){
    if(year %% 400 == 0){
      return(TRUE)
    } else{
      return(FALSE)
    }
  }
  
  if(year %% 4 == 0){
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
  
  
}


```

this function tests whether a year is a leap year

the first IF checks for centenary years (ie  year divisable by 100)
IF the centenary year is also divisable by 400 then its a leap year
Otherwise the centenary year is not a lear year

the second IF checks ALL NON-centenary years (ie dont divide by 100)
IF the year is divisable by 4 its a leap year
otherwise the year is not a leap year

expect_equal(): checking that the object gives the answer we expect
expect_error(): checking that the code throws an error when it should


```{r}
a <- 10
```

```{r}
expect_equal(a, 10)
```

```{r}
expect_equal(a, 11)
```
# test_that()

```{r}

test_that("Real leap year return TRUE", {
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(2020), TRUE)
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(2000), TRUE)
})





test_that("Real leap year return FALSE", {
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(3), FALSE)
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(1900), FALSE)
})


```

Task - 5 minutes
Take the following test code and write down an explanation of all the different parts:

What is the test name?

Test description is Character input returns an error, test name may be expect error

What is the expectation?

Expectation seems to be that in inputting a character there will be an error


What are you expecting this test to do?

seem to be wanting an error by inputting a character into a function that wants a numeric input.
expect error




Think carefully about the logic of this one before you write down your assumptionsâ€¦ you may want to try and run it to see what happens first.

# second test : one expectation

test_that("Character input returns an error", {
  expect_error(is_leap_year("year"))
})
## Test passed ðŸŽ‰


test description is character input returns an erro


```{r}
test_that("Character input returns an error", {
  expect_error(is_leap_year("year"))
})

test_that("Character input returns an error", {
  expect_error(is_leap_year(2010))
})
```


```{r}

test_that("Non-numeric input returns an error", {
  expect_error(is_leap_year("year"))
  expect_error(is_leap_year(TRUE)) # R can force TURE/FALSE into year 1/0 so thats happening here and it doesnt run an error
})

```


```{r}

is_leap_year <- function(year){
  
  # add in a start condition for non-numeric data
  if(!is.numeric(year)){
    stop("Non-numeric input") # causes function to stop and kick out an error message, plus the text in the brackets
  }
  
  if (year %% 100 == 0){
    if(year %% 400 == 0){
      return(TRUE)
    } else{
      return(FALSE)
    }
  }
  
  if(year %% 4 == 0){
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
  
  
}


```


```{r}

test_that("Non-numeric input returns an error", {
  expect_error(is_leap_year("year"))
  expect_error(is_leap_year(TRUE)) # R can force TURE/FALSE into year 1/0 so thats happening here and it doesnt run an error
})

```

Write a test that checks whether 2017 and 1900 are correctly identified as not being leap years by our is_leap_year() function.

```{r}

# This test expects the function "is leap_year" to return FALSE for the 2 given inputs namely 2017 and 1900

test_that("Non leap years should return FALSE", {
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(2017), FALSE)
  expect_equal(is_leap_year(1900), FALSE)
})

```
