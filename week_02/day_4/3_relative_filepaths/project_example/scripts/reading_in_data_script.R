#check what your working directory is
getwd()
#you should see it's the root directory of the project (i.e. wherever the .Rproj file sits)

#using tab navigate to the students.csv which is saved in the 'data' folder in the same folder as this .R file
read_csv("data/students.csv")
#you will see this filepath is relative to the project.
